# Binary Search

## Problems and variations of binary search
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Order agnostic Binary Search (Identify the order first and then use binary search)
- First and last occurence of an element in sorted array
- Count of element in sorted array
- Find element in rotated array
- Searching in a nearly sorted array
- Closest Number in sorted array
- kth smallest element in two sorted arrays
- median of two sorted arrays
- spoj ballot
- number of rotations
- square root of a number
- Floor/ceil of an element
- Next letter
- Index of last 1 in sorted array
- Find the position of an element in an infite sorted array
- Bitonic array max element
- search in Bitonic array
- search in row wise and column wise sorted matrix
- find element in sorted array that appears only once
- Allocate Min number of pages**

## Identification Techniques
#### Hint 1 - Input is Sorted Array
#### Hint 2 - Brute force TC - O(n^2) (if j is dependent on i)
#### Hint 3 - Try to identify the pattern and it's variation
